## **First Glance of the Data**
```{r}
df1 <- read.csv("LS2014Candidate.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE, na.strings = c("", NA, "NULL"))
head(df1)
summary(df1)
```
It can be seen that this data contains independent candidates as well as the None of the above option for each constituency.
  
  
### Question 1: Total number of candidates that contested the election?
```{r}
df_updated <- df1[-which(df1$Candidate.Name == "None of the Above"), ]
write.csv(df_updated, "Updated_df.csv")
#nota <- length(which(df1$Candidate.Name == "None of the Above"))
df1 <- read.csv("Updated_df.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE, na.strings = c("", NA, "NULL"))
num_candidates <- length(df1$Candidate.Name)
print(paste("The total number of candidates that contested the 2014 Lok Sabha Elections are", num_candidates))
```
### Question 2: What was the **Gender** composition of the candidates?
```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
df2 <- subset(df1, Candidate.Name != "None of the Above")
gender <- as.table(table(df_updated$Candidate.Sex))
barplot(gender, col = brewer.pal(n = 2, name = "Set3"), border = "White")
prop.table(gender)
```

### Question 3: What was the **Category** composition of the candidates?
```{r}
category <- as.table(table(df2$Candidate.Category))
pie(category, main = "Category Composition of the candidates", col = brewer.pal(n = length(df2$Candidate.Category), name = "Set3"), border = "White")
prop.table(category)
```
### Question 4: What is the age-group of maximum number of candidates?
```{r}
hist(as.numeric(as.character(df2$Candidate.Age)), main = paste("Histogram of Age group of the candidates"), xlab = "Age group", col = brewer.pal(n = 11, name = "Set3"), border = "white", density = 100, angle = 0)
```


This shows that the maximum candidates belong to the age group of 40-45 years. 


### Question 5: How many political parties contested the elections?
```{r}
parties <- table(df2$Party.Abbreviation)
print(paste(length(parties) - 1, "parties contested the elections"))
```
### Question 6: Top ten political parties that contested most number of seats?
```{r}
summary(df2$Party.Abbreviation, maxsum = 12)
```
The top 10 political parties were BSP, INC, AAAP, BJP. BMUP, SP, AITC, CPM, JD(U), CPI(ML) (IND stands for independent, hence not included)

### Question 7: What was the category distribution of the candidates by these ten political parties? 
```{r}
df3 <- subset(df2, df2$Party.Abbreviation == "BSP")
df4 <- subset(df2, df2$Party.Abbreviation == "INC")

df12 <- subset(df2, df2$Party.Abbreviation == "CPI(ML)(L)")


df13 <- rbind(df3, df4, df5, df6, df7, df8, df9, df10, df11, df12)
xtabs(~Party.Abbreviation+Candidate.Category, data = df13, addNA = FALSE, drop.unused.levels = TRUE)
table2 <- xtabs(~Party.Abbreviation+Candidate.Category, data = df13, addNA = FALSE, drop.unused.levels = TRUE)
barplot(table2, legend.text = TRUE, col = brewer.pal(n = 10, name = "Set3"), border = "White")
```

### Question 8: What is the Gender composition of the candidates belonging to these parties?
```{r}
xtabs(~Party.Abbreviation+Candidate.Sex, data = df13, addNA = FALSE, drop.unused.levels = TRUE)
table3 <- xtabs(~Party.Abbreviation+Candidate.Sex, data = df13, addNA = FALSE, drop.unused.levels = TRUE)
barplot(table3, legend.text = TRUE,  col = brewer.pal(n = 10, name = "Set3"), border = "White")
```

```

### Question 12: Which state has the highest number of constituencies?

total_votes <- sum(df2$Total.Votes.Polled)
df_bjp <- subset(df2, df2$Party.Abbreviation == "BJP")

share <- round(total_votes_bjp/total_votes, 4)
print(paste(share * 100, "%"))
```
### Question 15: In which state did INC win the highest number of seats?
```{r}
df_max_inc <- subset(df_max_seats, df_max_seats$Party.Abbreviation == "INC")

```


### Question 16: What is the total vote-share of INC?
